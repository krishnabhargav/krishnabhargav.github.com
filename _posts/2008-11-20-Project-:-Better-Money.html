<p>Everyone says the economy is bad and we will all be in a crisis. And those who know me well can definitely say that my finance management skills are very bad. Now I wanted to utilize my programming skills to develop a personal finance analysis tool. The idea is to use the Wesabe API to get all my finance data and give it to a nice little WPF-based visualization tool - Better Money.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.wesabe.com/">Wesabe</a>, for those who do not know about this is a online money management tool. It is a great tool where you can add bank accounts and watch your income and expenditure. It is a great tool and the best part of it is that its just a startup!</p>  <p>I have gathered enough information and I know exactly on how to proceed with the development. I have not yet decided on the features that the tool shall have, but my initial plan is to develop a C# library to the Wesabe REST API. The documentation provided by Wesabi is excellent and tells you nothing more than what you really need. The C# library is intended to stand-alone so that anyone with much better GUI skills than me can utilize it instead of dealing with the REST calls. I would keep posting on the project progress every now and then. The intended release date for the C# library is 24th November 2008. As of the <strong>Better Money</strong> suite, I intend to release it before Christmas. <strong>Both the library and the suite would be free - do what ever you want as long as I do not get penalized.</strong></p>  <p>If someone from Wesabe finds this post offensive and do not want me to release either the&#160; code or the tool, then please send me an email at <a href="mailto:krishnabhargav@yahoo.com">krishnabhargav@yahoo.com</a>. The idea is not to make money but help others and in the process I do not want to be slammed with a lawsuit.</p>  <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:dcc82f36-505c-4d60-b1c2-ee962d068383" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/better%20money" rel="tag">better money</a></div>
