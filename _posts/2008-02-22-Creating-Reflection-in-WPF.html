I have been playing with WPF for a while ... and I could create something like this... a button with reflection.<br /><br /><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5169818740433746226" style="DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Oy9HuksgrdU/R77iwOi1-TI/AAAAAAAAAKI/8hfvHRrMh_U/s320/reflection.png" border="0" />
