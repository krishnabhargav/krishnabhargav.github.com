<div style="text-align: justify;">I was just wondering how much DotNetNuke is getting popular. At RAC, I often see atleast one major DNN project every week. By major i mean it would definitely take a week or more to complete. Hey wait! What is DNN?<br /><br />Well DotNetNuke is a community effort - a CMS that could be used as internet and intranet web applications. Written entirely in asp.net, it is as good as any other CMS. PhP is widely used for CMS and there are excellent such CMS in the form of phpBB, vBulletin.<br /><br />Well one thing that unlike most think, CMS is not all about Forums, but it is much more. Take a look at PhpNuke based portals you can see how powerful they are. For us what interests more is that a well accepted CMS generates a lot of jobs, be it part time or full time. Like I happened to notice quite a few custom module development projects for DNN. So isnt it good?<br /><br />That is the reason, i wanted to learn something about DotNetNuke, if possible contribute all i can to the Microsoft Open Source Community. If i can get atleast 10% out of DNN by end of March, then i would consider myself efficient. Trust me, there is going to be a lot of future and opportunities for those who are well versed with DNN. It has become so much popular in just an year and half(when i first learnt asp.net, Dnn wasnt that popular) There are jobs, especially my fellow guys/gals who wish to pursue MS abroad - you should learn DNN if you are well versed with ASP.NET<br /><br />These days Video Based training has become so much popular. Even DNN has good training videos available, at their website, heres the link.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Documentation: http://keihanna.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/dnn/DotNetNuke_4.0.2_Docs.zip<br />Training videos at :<br />http://www.dotnetnuke.com/About/TrainingVideos/tabid/810/Default.aspx<br /><br /></span>Believe me guys, I am not wrong most of the time especially in catching things useful for career. First when i opted to learn .NET most of the people laughed thinking its not such a good idea, but today it has given me part time job and lots of satisfaction. So those who are familiar with .NET and vb.net language, you better lay your hands on DNN. join hands with me - we can learn things together.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></span></div>
