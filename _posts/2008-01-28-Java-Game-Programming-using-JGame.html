I came across this wonderful 2D Game Engine called JGame. This is a very good engine to write simple games and with just 100 odd lines of code, you can write wonderful games! I would post a series of tutorials shortly, but meanwhile it is a good point to start<br />http://www.13thmonkey.org/~boris/jgame/JGame/tutorial/<br />Great work Boris Van Schooten!! Really amazing!
