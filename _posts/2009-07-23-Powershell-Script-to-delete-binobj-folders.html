Shown below is a simple powershell script that can be used to clean up a solution folder. The script excludes the "Libraries" directory and deletes any folder named bin or obj in the specified location.<br /><br /><pre name="code" class="C#"><br />Get-childitem c:\Temp\MyProjectSolutionFolder -recurse -include *.exe,*.dll,*.pdb,*.exe.config, bin,obj | where {$_ -notmatch 'Libraries'} | Remove-Item -Recurse<br /></pre><br /><br />This script saves my time a lot and also does not require me to install any tools that does the same but adds registry entries for explorer context menu.<br /><br />NOTE: Please verify thoroughly before blindly running the script. Use the -WhatIf flag to simulate the execution of the command instead of actually running it.
