When compiled using GCC compiler, can you tell what is the output of the following program?<br /><br />#include<stdio h=""><br />int main()<br />{<br />int y=10,p=20;<br />int num[10]={0};<br />int x=10,z=4;<br /><br />num[-2] = -2;<br />num[10] = 10;<br />printf("%d\n%d\n",p,z);<br />}<br /><br />This program is supposed to be compiled on SunOS, using GCC compiler. Running it on different machine might give a totally different output.<br /><br />If you run this program, you would understand how dangerous is C++ arrays, if not properly coded. Ofcourse this program does not actually corrupt your system but it does corrupt one of the variables and at times this might be dangerous.<br /><br />Courtesy: Got this snippet from Dr. Dave's class. But a different example. I really liked this simple program that conveys a very big idea.
