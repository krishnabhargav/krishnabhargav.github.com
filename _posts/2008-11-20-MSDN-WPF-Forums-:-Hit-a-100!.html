<p>On September 24th 2008, I decided that I would like to improve my WPF skills. By that time, I already had decent understanding of some important concepts in WPF (minus Hit-Testing, Commands). And I always believed that contributing to forums helps others and at the same time it gives you great knowledge - you try things for others and in the process you learn something new with every post you make.</p>  <p>Finally, I reached 100+ answers which means that 103 of my posts were answers to the questions. It is a nice feeling to help people with 100 issues - big or small, it does not matter.</p>  <p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_Oy9HuksgrdU/SSWAREtAbVI/AAAAAAAAAvE/Z-n-WzfmGNg/s1600-h/image%5B16%5D.png"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="36" alt="image" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_Oy9HuksgrdU/SSWAR9CJ_pI/AAAAAAAAAvI/-tH8mwiwmes/image_thumb%5B12%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="644" border="0" /></a></p>  <p>So, I gave 103 answers in less than 2 months, which I think is pretty decent given that I am working full-time and also a graduate student at UGA.</p>  <p>My profile</p>  <p><a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/users/#page:1;searchexpression:krishnabhargava">http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/users/#page:1;searchexpression:krishnabhargava</a></p>
