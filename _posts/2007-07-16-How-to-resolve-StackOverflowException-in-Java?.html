Well, not only when you use deep recursion that you encounter a StackOverflowException but also when you serialize objects you might see this exception.<br />Well you can always avoid this error by setting a VM option to java, either from eclipse or when you run it from command line, as an argument.<br />If it is in Eclipse, go to the Run dialog of the current Java program that you wish to run and go to the second tab (arguments I guess) and then in the VM Options you can set "-Xss1024K" which means that any thread that runs on Java VM will be allotted a Stack size of 1 MB which is quite enough for most of the cases.<br />If you wish to serialize data that has a lot of interlinked references then you might want to keep it something really high, just to be on safer side.<br />Interesting stuff is going on in the DBMS class at my university and we are learning really good stuff especially the performance oriented nature of DB algorithms! I enjoy the programming assignments, its fun to learn and code!
