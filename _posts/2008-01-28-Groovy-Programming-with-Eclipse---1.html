In this short series of Groovy posts, I intend to cover some Groovy fundas and at the same time myself learn the platform. I will work on Eclipse and would not work at console level and instead use Groovy plugin on Eclipse.<br />1. Installing Groovy Plugin for Eclipse.<br /><ul><li>Start Eclipse. Go to Help->Software Updates->Find and Install.</li><li>Select "Search for new features to install" and click Next.</li><li>Click on "New Remote Site"</li><li>Give a name say "Groovy Plugin" and in the URL put "<a href="http://dist.codehaus.org/groovy/distributions/update/">http://dist.codehaus.org/groovy/distributions/update/</a>"</li><li>Click Ok. Now select the newly added remote site and then click Finish. Follow the on-screen instructions and majorly you need to click "Install All" and then restart Eclipse for the changes to be effected.</li></ul><p>2. Testing your Groovy installation on Eclipse.</p><ul><li>Create a new project in Java. </li><li>Now in the Package Explorer right click on the project. You should see a "Groovy" item in the context menu.</li><li>So go to the Groovy item in the context menu and go to "Groovy->Add Groovy Nature".</li><li>Doing this would kind of convert our Java project to Groovy project. We can now run and test our Groovy programs.</li><li>Now right click on the project and create a new package. Say "groovy.learning.samples".</li><li>Then right click on the project and click on "New->Other". Type Groovy in the "type filter text" textbox. Now select "Groovy Class" and give it a name.(Tutorial1).</li><li>Type the following line inside the code block already generated. Essentially you see a main already inserted.<br />"println("Welcome to Groovy World");</li><li>Save the file. Now go to the menu "Run->Run As->Groovy Application". You should be able to see the message printed in the console. If so , you have successfully installed Groovy plugin on eclipse and good to write your Groovy programs.</li></ul><p>This post, I hope, gives a quickstart to get started working with Groovy on Eclipse. In the subsequent posts, I hope to cover other basic programming constructs in Groovy.</p>
