Recently, I have worked on almost three projects involving only serilization. I mean pure serialization. Right now i have a work to do, so I just want to save a link on my blog.<br />This is an excellent article on Serialization and how one can create an advanced Binary Serializer.<br />Also shows how to perform encrypted Serialization,Compression,etc.<br /><br />http://www.marcclifton.com/Articles/Performance/RawSerializer/tabid/130/Default.aspx<br /><br />I can also show you real world use of serialization when i talk about it later. Also i would show how to perform FTP UPload/Download in .NET( my latest project is that) using two different ways - using WebClient and other using FtpWebRequest/Response(.NEt 2.0 only)<br /><br /><br />For now that is it.
