Thanks to Mike Taulty, famous for MSDN Nuggets, that I started to learn LINQ. Will post the exact link sometime later.<br />But these are the various LINQ techs coming up:<br />1. LINQ to SQL<br />2. LINQ to XML<br />3. LINQ to Entities<br />4. DLinq<br />5. BLinq<br />and much more.<br /><br />Before that I would recommend to learn the new changes in C# 3.0. The nuggets could be found here<br />http://www.microsoft.com/uk/msdn/nuggets/tags/C%23%20Version%203.0/default.aspx?pg=1<br /><br />I am yet to watch these videos and once done! I would post some hello world! kind of programs that can help people like me to learn easily. Most of these videos usually use a very complex kind of examples and sometimes it is good while sometimes it is not so good!<br /><br />More later...
