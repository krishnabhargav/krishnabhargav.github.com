As always, I am big fan of Microsoft products. So the intention of this post is not to make fun of Microsoft or Live products, but something that I felt funny. Take a look at the Live translation of my previous blog entry.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Oy9HuksgrdU/R6xpCnAb91I/AAAAAAAAAKA/nj1c1SiSDDs/s1600-h/spanish+post.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Oy9HuksgrdU/R6xpCnAb91I/AAAAAAAAAKA/nj1c1SiSDDs/s320/spanish+post.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5164618366238586706" border="0" /></a>Firstly, I do not understand spanish but still I tried a <a href="http://translator.live.com/">live translation</a> and I found my code to be really funny after it  gets translated. May be there should be some research going on, to identify the context of the text and based on that invoke translation! But until then, I find it funny.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>
