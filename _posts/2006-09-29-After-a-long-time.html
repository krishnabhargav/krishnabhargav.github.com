Well hi to those non-existent visitors of my blog ! :)<br /><br />Lots of work got updated on the Microsoft development front(in my unfortunate absence). Anyway this post is to just store a link about UpdateControl, an aTlas how-to. Wonderful job done, i find it pretty soothing as i have just completed reading Atlas At Last:MSDN Mag article. Take a look at the how-to :<br /><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/trobbins/articles/678575.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/trobbins/articles/678575.aspx</a><br /><br />Wish I had a PC at the place I stay :(
