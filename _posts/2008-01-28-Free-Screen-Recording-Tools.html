I have been searching a lot for free Camtasia alternatives that would allow me to prepare screencasts. Till date I have found three good tools<br /><br />1. Free Screen Recorder <br />http://www.nbxsoft.com/screen-recorder.php<br />Pretty decent tool, allows you to save screencast as AVI files. Best option is to download Vista Codec Package from http://www.free-codecs.com/download/Vista_Codec_Package.htm and in the settings choose XVID compression with as least quality as you want. You can record voice too.<br /><br />2. DebugMode Wink<br />http://www.debugmode.com/wink/<br />A much more complicated software, allows you to store captures as SWF files. Lots of options but little bit uneasy to use.<br /><br />3. CamStudio<br />http://camstudio.org/<br />Free and open source. But resource intensive. Good for high end systems.<br /><br />Another good tool is ZoomIt by SysInternals. It helps you zoom particular portion of screen, would be useful when u want to show something more clearly, during presentations or screencasts. Free download from<br />http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897434.aspx<br /><br />More on sysinternals tools, you get awesome little tools at http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/0e18b180-9b7a-4c49-8120-c47c5a693683.aspx and they are all free. Amazing tools, trust me.
