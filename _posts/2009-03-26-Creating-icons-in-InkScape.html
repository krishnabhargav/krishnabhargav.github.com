<p> Because of my recent obsession to update my skills on Design (I think I am a decent programmer and with the design skills on my resume, it would be nice!), I created my first icon using Inkscape.</p>  <p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_Oy9HuksgrdU/Scu6lhX1KjI/AAAAAAAAA0I/Cd1FiS4T8pA/s1600-h/icon.bmp%5B5%5D.png"><img title="icon.bmp" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="104" alt="icon.bmp" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_Oy9HuksgrdU/Scu6lxxBNuI/AAAAAAAAA0M/5aEI-cdQc4M/icon.bmp_thumb%5B3%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="97" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p>Ok – this isnt anyway close to the normal most stupid looking icons but hey I have an excuse – I am not a designer.</p>  <p>Anyway, as you work on Inkscape and try exporting your work as icon, I could not notice any export format as .ico. So here is what i did. I exported my work as a PNG (File-&gt;Export as Bitmap..) and then using <a href="http://www.convertico.com/">http://www.convertico.com/</a> I converted my PNG&#160; to an icon!</p>  <p>For tutorial on working with inkscape</p>  <p><a href="http://screencasters.heathenx.org/episode-055/">http://screencasters.heathenx.org/episode-055/</a></p>  <p>change episode-055 from episode-001 onwards.</p>  <p>:)</p>
