<p>As I was looking for embedded database systems, I came across this pure python database called KirbyBase. So I decided that I would make it run on IronPython. So this post describes on how to make KirbyBase run on IronPython and using ipy.exe. Note that I am not looking at integrating this database into C# application yet. [may be in the future post]</p>  <p>So what are the steps?</p>  <p>1. Get the latest IronPython and install it on your machine. You should be seeing ipy.exe in the installation directory.</p>  <p>2. Get the <a href="http://www.netpromi.com/kirbybase_python.html">KirbyBase download from its website</a>.</p>  <p>3. Download and install Python 2.6 whose libraries are required to run the database tests.</p>  <p>4. Once Kirbybase and Python 2.6 are installed, look for kbtest.py inside kirbybase installation directory.</p>  <p>5. Copy the kbtest.py into the directory which has ipy.exe (the IronPython installation directory).</p>  <p>6. Modify the kbtest.py to include the Python and KirbyBase directories into the path. The final result should look something like shown below.</p>  <p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_Oy9HuksgrdU/Sh2oS-fqxbI/AAAAAAAAA0o/jSlhbVH2Z44/s1600-h/image%5B3%5D.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_Oy9HuksgrdU/Sh2oS8i6gtI/AAAAAAAAA0s/2AF6rEflp9A/image_thumb%5B1%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="420" height="313" /></a> </p>  <p>Notice that I have moved “import sys” statement ahead of “import os”. The lines 2 and 3 adds the directories for Python2.6 and KirbyBase to the path.</p>  <p>Then from command prompt type in the following</p>  <p><strong>ipy kbtest.py</strong></p>  <p>The result should look like shown below.</p>  <p><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_Oy9HuksgrdU/Sh2oTCIum4I/AAAAAAAAA0w/q-vPiXWTITo/s1600-h/image%5B9%5D.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_Oy9HuksgrdU/Sh2oTT1jfDI/AAAAAAAAA00/f0_KgrTOwqw/image_thumb%5B5%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="636" height="782" /></a> </p>  <p>May be next time, I would like to see what it takes to integrate this database into C# application. Until then, have a nice time. Let me know if you have better approaches than what I did here. Thank you.</p>
