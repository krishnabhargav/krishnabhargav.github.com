I was wondering how many elements of a type can you store in a<br />1. HashMap<br />2. Vector<br />3. ArrayList<br />4. Stack<br />and other Collections.<br />This is what i found. With the default Heap space intact,<br />ArrayList can store 33,07,499 Long or Integers and around 1222441 Strings(I am not sure how long)<br />Stack and Vector, including HashMap<string,string> can store upto 1236653 Strings. While around 26,21,441 integral types could be stored.<br /><br />I am not sure if this is same across all machines. Well this atleast gives me an idea to what extent i can go without facing OutOfMemoryError.
