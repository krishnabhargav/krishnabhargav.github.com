Just wanted to say more - if any of you guys need some kind of help in resolving bugs for your .NET projects, feel free to contact me at <span style="font-weight: bold;">krishnabhargav@yahoo.com</span>; you need any code snippets, just ask over here. I really have a lot of code with me, and I am ready to share with you all. But hey, dont demand - i am an head strong egotist. So better, request and leave. I shall definitely answer any question within my reach. That one thing i can promise.
