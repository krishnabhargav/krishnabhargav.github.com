<p>I am an active contributor to the MSDN WPF Forums and most of the times I go to the forums through the search engine. And being an ardent supporter of Microsoft, I made Bing my default search engine on my home desktop. So I searched for “MSDN Social” and look what one of the sponsored result is!</p>  <p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_Oy9HuksgrdU/Sj1ICzxCa8I/AAAAAAAAA60/e3WHDtqMUgs/s1600-h/image%5B4%5D.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_Oy9HuksgrdU/Sj1ID84wrHI/AAAAAAAAA64/SR4_UZ9BLQM/image_thumb%5B2%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="570" height="458" /></a> </p>  <p>seriously we are in the 21st century. And BING “decided” for me that I want to visit BAD GIRLS IN MY AREA! when all I wanted to do was to visit MSDN Social Forums. Bing – get a life.</p>
