<p>I was just trying to run scala on my machine and failed to do so with an error message “…..\java.exe unexpected at this time.” Look at the screenshot shown below.</p>  <p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_Oy9HuksgrdU/SvOyB_1mOMI/AAAAAAAABHQ/KTkg54VOgJ0/s1600-h/image%5B6%5D.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_Oy9HuksgrdU/SvOyCOu-IwI/AAAAAAAABHU/HlacqeXVaUw/image_thumb%5B2%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="644" height="327" /></a></p>  <p>Well, the problem was that environment variables for JAVA was set up using JAVA_HOME variable. The JAVA_HOME environment variable was pointing to the JDK directory and the Path was modified to include the “%JAVA_HOME%\bin” directory.</p>  <p>I removed the JAVA_HOME and then modified the path to specify the complete path to the JDK bin folder and it works now. :)</p>  <p>I might be talking more about Scala in the future, the concurrency scala supports appears to be interesting.</p>
