After long long attempts to learn - understand the Mean Shift tracking, I have finally implemented the Kernel Based Object Tracking in Java. First I have tried to implement the tracker in openCV but I had some problems with the rectangle selection(the bounding box) so I moved back to Java and implemented the code offline using Java Media FrameWork. I have written a nice small class using JMF which we can use to extract frames out of a given Video file. There is no support for WMV format - it says NoPlayerException and some DivX formats, but then most of the files were played successfully.<br /><br />My tracking results are shown below. Shown are the first, 19th and the 10th frame of a striker - video courtesy "WEB".<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Oy9HuksgrdU/RgxC1TmFjyI/AAAAAAAAAAM/gcl9pN23vN8/s1600-h/01.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Oy9HuksgrdU/RgxC1TmFjyI/AAAAAAAAAAM/gcl9pN23vN8/s320/01.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5047482765936004898" border="0" /></a><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Oy9HuksgrdU/RgxC1jmFj0I/AAAAAAAAAAc/ABQM4cRgWZM/s1600-h/19.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Oy9HuksgrdU/RgxC1jmFj0I/AAAAAAAAAAc/ABQM4cRgWZM/s320/19.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5047482770230972226" border="0" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Oy9HuksgrdU/RgxC1jmFjzI/AAAAAAAAAAU/FXbF5yV0GNs/s1600-h/10.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Oy9HuksgrdU/RgxC1jmFjzI/AAAAAAAAAAU/FXbF5yV0GNs/s320/10.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5047482770230972210" border="0" /></a>
