A good library for developing Peer-To-Peer applications is being developed by me and a friend. The aim is to enable ease of development of a Peer to Peer System. For now, you can write a peer as<br />public class MyOwnPeer extends Peer<br />{<br />//implement few methods!<br />}<br />The peers identify each other through IP Multicasting. In a day or two, I hope to write a short tutorial on how to develop a P2P chat application using our library. For now, it runs within private networks only. And does not run across internet!<br /><br />Also the library at its current stage enables very easy development of Server application! you can write your echo server without having to worry about threading or anything else!<br />It is as simple as<br />public class EchoServer extends ServerComponent<br />{<br />//implement few methods!<br />}<br /><br />We hope to release the library as early as possible.<br /><br />The echo server sample is shown below!<br />Isnt' that easy! This is just the very initial stages of development and hopefully the library grows to something really big. The library relies heavily on Object-Oriented Concepts !<br /><span style="font-family: arial; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);font-size:85%;" >// SAMPLE SERVER CODE!!<br />class EchoServer extends ServerComponent {<br /><br />    public EchoServer(int port) {<br />        super(port);<br />    }<br /><br />    @Override<br />    public void beforeServerStarts() {<br />        System.out.println("Server about to start");<br />    }<br /><br />    @Override<br />    public void onIncomingConnection(Socket socket) {<br />        try {<br />            BufferedReader buff = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(<br />                    socket.getInputStream()));<br />            PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream());<br />            String temp = "";<br />            while ((temp = buff.readLine()) != null) {<br />                pw.println(temp);<br />                pw.flush();<br />            }<br />        } catch (IOException e) {<br />            // TODO Auto-generated catch block<br />            e.printStackTrace();<br />        }<br />    }<br /><br />    @Override<br />    public void onServerStarted() {<br />        System.out.println("Server Started!");<br />    }<br /><br />    public static void main(String[] args) {<br />        EchoServer my = new EchoServer(1233);<br />    }<br />}<br /></span>
