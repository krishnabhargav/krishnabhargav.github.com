<p>When you perform pointer arithmetic, you move the pointer to the next or previous element of the array. When you say ptr++ where ptr is an integer pointer, it is equivalent to ptr = ptr + 4 (mathematically) assuming integer is of 4 bytes.</p>  <p>Do not do math on pointers that does not point to array. If one keeps this in mind, then you would probably prevent most of the problems.</p>  <p>The following code snippet is perfectly legal:   <br /><span style="color: #0000ff">     <br />int</span> *ptr = array;    <br />ptr = ptr+2;    <br />ptr--;    <br />ptr++;    <br />    <br />Consider the following declaration:    <br /><span style="color: #0000ff">     <br />int</span> numbers[10];    <br />    <br />In the above declaration, <strong>numbers</strong> is of type <strong>int const*. </strong>This implies that <strong>numbers</strong> even though is a pointer, is a constant pointer and it cannot appear on the left side of an expression(as a pointer).</p>  <p><span style="color: #0000ff">int</span> *numbers;    <br />    <br />In the above shown declaration,<strong>numbers </strong>is of type <strong>int*. </strong>It can still point to an array of itegers and you can actually do a math and can appear on the left side of an expression. So the statement numbers++ in this case is perfectly legal while in the previous case; it is not legal.    <br />    <br />    <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:5b61d670-3b30-44b5-a982-637c3f6aaa1a" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/C++" rel="tag">C++</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Dave" rel="tag">Dave</a></div></p>
