        <h1 class="post-title">Do I really understand Java? or Computer Science, for that matter?</h1>

        <section class="post-content">
            <p>Like I mentioned in my previous post, I was with Javaground being interviewed for the Developer position. It was an overall amazing and a great learning experience. I am so much thrilled for having interviewed with them that I have been thinking a lot on how I could be like them. The java we write is so lame. I gave a talk on optimizations and now I feel embarassed that I am not eligible to give such a talk. And I did cover a lot of material and left out a lot. But talking with the Javaground team made me realize that I am not as good I felt I was.  <p>I was honored to be in their guest house along with a developer from their Canada team. He was Nigel and I should say that he was amazing and very impressive, very pleasant to talk and very down to earth. He told me simple things that no one would ever find in a book, I bet. So the aspect he told me was "comparisons with a 0(zero) is much faster than with any other numbers". This was just one of the quiet a lot of information he shared with me. Though not always "java" we talked about, he told me various other things - about life as a mobile developer, how mobile game works, stuff like that.  <p>Anyway, I decided I would look into the "comparison with zero" to understand more. So just now I wrote two simple programs - Hello and Hello2. The Hello.java looks something like this:  <p>public class Hello{ <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public static void main(String[] args) { <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int i = 0; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if(i &lt; 1) System.out.println("Test");<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>} <p>The result of running javap is shown. (After compiling with javac) <br><strong>javap -c -private -verbose Hello </strong></p> <p>Let me show you the output .... <br></p> <p>Compiled from Hello.java<br>public class Hello extends java.lang.Object {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public Hello();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* Stack=1, Locals=1, Args_size=1 */<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public static void main(java.lang.String[]);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* Stack=2, Locals=2, Args_size=1 */<br>}  <p>Method Hello()<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 aload_0<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 invokespecial #1 &lt;Method java.lang.Object()&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 return  <p>Method void main(java.lang.String[])<br><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 iconst_0<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 istore_1<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 iload_1<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 iconst_1<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 if_icmpge 15<br></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; 7 getstatic #2 &lt;Field java.io.PrintStream out&gt;<br>&nbsp; 10 ldc #3 &lt;String "test"&gt;<br>&nbsp; 12 invokevirtual #4 &lt;Method void println(java.lang.String)&gt;<br>&nbsp; 15 return <p>I have made the lines of interest bold. Now my Hello2.java looks like this:  <p>public class Hello2{ <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public static void main(String[] args) { <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int i = 0; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if(i &lt; 0) System.out.println("Test");<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>} <p>Now let us look at the <strong>javap</strong> output shown in the listing. <p>Compiled from Hello2.java<br>public class Hello2 extends java.lang.Object {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public Hello2();<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* Stack=1, Locals=1, Args_size=1 */<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public static void main(java.lang.String[]);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /* Stack=2, Locals=2, Args_size=1 */<br>}  <p>Method Hello2()<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 aload_0<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 invokespecial #1 &lt;Method java.lang.Object()&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 return  <p>Method void main(java.lang.String[])<br><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 iconst_0<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 istore_1<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 iload_1<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 ifge 14<br></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; 6 getstatic #2 &lt;Field java.io.PrintStream out&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 9 ldc #3 &lt;String "test"&gt;<br>&nbsp; 11 invokevirtual #4 &lt;Method void println(java.lang.String)&gt;<br>&nbsp; 14 return <p>As you can see the highlighted section again, we would notice an operation missing. So let me put the areas of interest together, side by side. <br></p> <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="400"> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top" width="200"> <p align="center"><strong>i &lt; 1 </strong></p></td> <td valign="top" width="200"> <p align="center"><strong>i &lt; 0</strong></p></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="200"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 iconst_0<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 istore_1<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 iload_1<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 iconst_1<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 if_icmpge 15</strong></td> <td valign="top" width="200"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 iconst_0<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 istore_1<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 iload_1<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 ifge 14<br></strong></td></tr></tbody></table> <p>Frankly, I do not understand the bytecode so well yet, but I do can make out that in comparison with a 1, there is an instruction that creates the constant 1. Where as for comparison with 0, that instruction is missing. I could recall something similar that we learning during Computer Architecture class and the Embedded Systems course that I attended. I wish I invested more time in those classes. How foolish I was back then?  <p>This is not a big deal when you have server class machines or a laptop for that matter. Saving a couple of instructions - no big deal. But in a mobile environment, it makes sense. So out of 200000 odd lines that we write, if we could only save 2 instructions per 100 lines, that would save us 2000 instructions !!! and it is a lot given the limited resources of a mobile device.  <p>I am very interested in gaining such knowledge and it is only possible, at the moment, when we work at companies like Javaground. I could get a job as a web developer or as a C# developer at any point of time in my life but opportunities like Javaground does not often come. And I have worked very hard for this opportunity. I gave 3 rigorous online tests, attended around 6 interviews and after all I wish if only I could prepare better. "If" i am lucky and "if" I get an offer from Javaground which is good enough for me to make a proper living, then I would see myself learning a lot from the immense talent that Javaground possess and hopefully one day see myself as one of their core people. I know there are a lot of such firms but at the moment, the only such firm that has interviewed me is Javaground.&nbsp; <p>The two days made me realize, there is so much I should learn! </p>
