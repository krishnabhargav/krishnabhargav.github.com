          <h2>Interview with CapGemini</h2>
<p class="meta">09 Feb 2008</p>

<div class="post">
I have tried to search for some links which would give me some information on interviewing with CapGemini U.S but could not find any thing that was free. Well, I thought I would share some of my experiences. I had an interview with CapGemini today at UGA with a Senior Manager and I guess I cannot mention his name without his consent.<br />Anyway the interview was for "Staff Technical Consulting". It was more about conversational interview and we did not talk much about technical aspects. The interviewer, I guess was looking for more on the behavioral aspects of me, as a prospective consultant. The questions were more on the lines of "describe a situation where you motivated a team", "describe a situation where you had a lot of work to do and less time", etc.<br />I think I did a good job, I answered the questions and let us see if i can make it.<br />For those who would attend a similar interview, in case you need some more information feel free to mail me at krishnabhargav@yahoo.com
