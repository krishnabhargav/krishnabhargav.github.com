        <h1 class="post-title">What is my favorite programming language?</h1>

        <section class="post-content">
            Well this was one of the tons of questions I was asked during my interview with Javaground. Anyway the environment at the company looked so serious and everyone was kind of busy all the time. I like such a challenging environment and have to see if I was "good enough" to be a part of it. I have an offer with a service company E*Trade but I am not too sure about it. Unless the pay is relatively less at Javaground, I do not want to lose an opportunity to work for them. If I work at Javaground, I would:<br />1. write optimized code, probably someday write a whole new book on code optimization.<br />2. work with one of the best minds in the software industry. great developers and everyone talks about compact and great code.<br />3. better future - game devs make a lot of 1. money 2. fame 3. knowledge about s/w and h/w.<br /><br />Atleast from what I see, I think they are looking for a good programmer who has strong basics and knows what he writes.<br /><strong>What is my favorite question?</strong><br />Xavier Kral, the CTO of javaground raised this question. I always felt different about different languages. So let me start one by one.<br />C - Definitely not my favorite.<br />C++ - Great language, but then not my favorite - I do not admire or adore pointers<br />Java - definitely a contender. Write great software in less amount of time. Java is a cool language. Come Java 7 you have closures and it would revamp the style of Java code.<br />C# - Right now, my best language. The language I am most good at. The C# 3.0 features are amazing.<br />Groovy - Definitely a great scripting language that is on top of JAva.<br />So what is my favorite? I feel confused. When I work on Java for a long time, I feel Java is the best thing that has happened to the developer community. But when I work on C# for a long time, I feel C# is much better than Java. So which is my best language? - I prefer C# when working on windows and I prefer Java when I want something on Linux. Both has its pros and cons.<br /><strong>Why game developer job?</strong><br />The charisma of a game developer is totally different. A game developer is more attractive to girls than a mainframe developer. I am kidding, but I like the challenge to work on real projects which constantly puts your skill to think and code to test. It is great to actually feel as a game developer. So again the reasons I list out are:<br />1. Game dev make a lot of money, if not now atleast in the near future.<br />2. Game dev tittle is more attractive than anything else.<br />3. If there is a possibility that I would own my company or become a major part of a startup, then it is possible only in the Game Development Industry.<br />4. Even if the economy is not all that great, Game Industry will always survive -> I would always be in demand and it would only increase with time.<br />5. If I work hard enough, I would end up becoming a very popular developer in the community.<br />6. The amount of knowledge you gain as a game developer is immense. You create a form of life in the form of games and you should feel close to god!
