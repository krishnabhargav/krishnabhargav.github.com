<div class="post">
With may 10th 2006, the first term with UGA will come to an end. Then I am planning to move on and work on GWT and ASP.NET. And as for my thesis, I am planning to work on P2p Media Streaming - especially I would like to study and enhance the current p2p media streaming networks and come up with something really good enough for my thesis. Hopefully I would stand on this and work further to bring up something good.<br />Just got few books on p2p computing in java and .NET, also the core technology book to study the underlying systems. Have to wait and see if this plan of mine will work!
