I just updated my Graduate Web Page at http://cs.uga.edu/~krishna<br />It was a good learning experience to come up with some decent color combinations. I used online color picker tools, well I dont have the link for the tools I used, but here is one good article that gives interesting insights on color-combinations.<br />http://www.limov.com/colour/schemes.lml<br /><br />I developed a similar tool in ASP.NET, first using non-AJAX approach and then made the application an AJAX one. It was a great feeling to develop an AJAX application and trust me, with ASP.NET AJAX, we can develop AJAXify any web application in no time and absolutely zero coding.<br />Here is what I did!<br />1. First I created a User Control, which had the pallette selection. Then drag and drop ScriptManager control and UpdatePanel on a new ASPX page.<br />2. Drag and drop the User Control you just created into the Update Panel.<br />3. Compile and run! all the changes in the page are ajaxified!!!<br />Absolutely no coding!!!!<br /><br />I always felt that I lacked good color scheme selection ability, but now with my own tool, I can select a variety of themes!!!<br /> I hope I have some online ASPX Web Hosting service. I intend to buy an ASPX portal very soon and then I can upload the tools I make once a while!
