          <h2>Impact of community participation on my blog</h2>
<p class="meta">11 Jan 2009</p>

<div class="post">
<p>For about one and half month, I was very much <a href="http://krishnabhargav.blogspot.com/2008/11/msdn-wpf-forums-hit-100.html" target="_blank">involved with the WPF community</a> on MSDN. At that time, I had around 50 visitors everyday, which to my standards is a pretty leap. If you look at the graph that compares the visitors, you notice a decent hike in the number of visitors.</p>  <p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_Oy9HuksgrdU/SWokMG3UtfI/AAAAAAAAAxY/6zniBlgbgBM/s1600-h/image%5B3%5D.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_Oy9HuksgrdU/SWokMcHRTwI/AAAAAAAAAxc/7CjPPZTYw40/image_thumb%5B1%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="644" height="104" /></a> </p>  <p>Notice the region with highest number of visitors between October 2008 and December 2008 which was when I was very active on MSDN community. Then I stopped my activity since I went lazy and then my visitors dropped â€“ which makes sense.</p>  <p>So fellow bloggers, if you want visitors, then be active on the community. My numbers are not high but at least they were doubled with my participation on MSDN community.</p>
