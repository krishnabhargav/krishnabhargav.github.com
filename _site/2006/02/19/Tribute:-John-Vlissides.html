Recently, i came across this thread on DevSourcel through which i came to know about the demise of Mr.<span class="Article_Title">John Vlissides. Well not many of us know him, but the core of software developers, the most professionals guys out here  definitely knows him as one of the "Gang of Four".<br />Heard of Design Patterns? If so then, you should know this person. Mr. Vlissides is one of the four persons at IBM who gave the world the notion of Design Patterns and more importantly the key person behind the launch of Project Eclipse. He expired after a 19 day illness due to brain cancer. Without his effort on design patterns and project Eclipse, the world of software would not have been what it is now. So please pray for him.<br /></span><span class="Article_Title"></span>
