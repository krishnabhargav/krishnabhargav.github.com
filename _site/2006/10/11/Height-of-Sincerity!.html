well the title would not make any sense for another two to three days. Thanks to my colleagues that I am nominated for the Best Learner and Best Guide awards for the FLP batch. Friday, the 13th! is a big day for us, FLPites. Its our Graduation day and the day when we get a hint of our "what next?"<br /><br />Old habits die hard and my taste for .NET still remains. So I often keep browsing about Microsoft and .NET. In that process I read some excellent blogs. One such blog is here. Its an index of Various "How-to-deploy" on Visual Studio. It is a must-look!<br /><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/astebner/articles/574618.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/astebner/articles/574618.aspx</a><br /><br />I would not change the heading of my blog. But I would like to post few comments on the currently technology I am working on! Surprisingly, inspite of not liking the platform, I am doing pretty well on Mainframes! As a developer who fine tuned his programming skills among OBJECTS, working on COBOL, developing applications with CICS appears awful. But still, you have to do it.<br /><br />One thing that we should appreciate about coding Cobol on Mainframes is, with the tools I used so far, I now feel that I can survive coding without the help of Visual Studio or Eclipse or any IDE for that matter. If you can manage a project on TSO, trust me, you can do wonders with Visual Studio and other IDEs.<br /><br />There is a lot to learn about Mainframes - CICS, COBOL and JCL! But still somehow I feel I dont belong here. I plan to move to .NET professionally too....<br /><br />More insights later. I also plan to post tips/guide for mainframe beginners! Now - I aint a beginner anymore and I do have valuable suggestions and tips on Mainframes too!
