The pics we take with a digital camera are usually around 1.5-3 MB based on the resolution. I often waste time and bandwidth to upload such big images in websites like snapfish, orkut, facebook, flickr. I always wanted a simple utility that could be used to compress images in a folder. I wrote one software during my BE but did not carry it with me to US so I always had to use some Paint.NET or other Image Processing tools. <br />I started my new year coding with Image Processing tool - trueBuddi Image Compressor. <br />I would upload it on my website. It is very easy to use and is available <br /><a href="http://cs.uga.edu/~krishna/BulkCompressor.zip">here</a><br />It requires .NET Framework 2.0 to run. Right now it compresses images within a specified folder and that too only those with .JPG extension.<br />Future revisions:<br />1. Individual File Compression<br />2. Image Processing Operations - Contrast enhancement, Brightness, Noise Reduction, Sharpening, etc.<br />3. Support for conversion among JPG, TIFF, PNG and other such types.<br />Ideas welcome. The tool is free to use and is not restricted with any kind of license. You can do a Reflector and anything that you want. Just do not change the title of the Frame.
