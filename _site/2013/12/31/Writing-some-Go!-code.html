This post is my notes when writing some code in Go lang. To start off, I will write a Hello World program in Go language. &nbsp;See below. <br /><pre class="c" name="code">package main<br /><br />import "fmt"<br /><br />func main(){<br /> messageToPrint := "Welcome to Go!"<br /> fmt.Printf(messageToPrint + "\n")<br />}<br /></pre><br />Now to run this, you can do one of the following : <br /><pre class="powershell" name="code">go run HelloWorld.go<br /></pre>OR <br /><br /><pre class="powershell" name="code">go build HelloWorld.go<br /></pre>In the first case, "go run" compiles the program and runs it. It does not create an executable as such. (It could be creating a temporary executable somewhere.) The second command actually builds an executable which you can run.  Go also has a tool called "gofmt" which you can run directly as gofmt or can run as   <br /><pre class="powershell" name="code">go fmt HelloWorld.go </pre>.   The formatting tool formats your source code so that it matches the Go-defined formatting. This is a good thing as each one of us need not invent our own coding conventions.  Gofmt can also be used to perform some code refactoring. In order to perform a rename variable, the following command does the trick.  <br /><pre class="powershell" name="code">gofmt -l -w -r 'messageToPrint -&gt; mesg' ./HelloWorld.go </pre>The above command would rename the messageToPrint variable as mesg. In general, you pass 'pattern -&gt; replaceWith' style of commands when using the -r option.  More information on what gofmt -r can be used for is available in this <a href="http://www2.gli.cas.cz/home/cejchan/go/gofmt-r.pdf">presentation</a> &nbsp;  <br /><div><br /><b>Writing a Web Server in Go!</b><br /><br />The following code snippet shows a Web Server that is written in Go! and also shows how to write anonymous functions in Go!<br /><pre class="c" name="code">package main<br /><br />import (<br /> "fmt"<br /> "net/http"<br />)<br /><br />func main() {<br /> fmt.Printf("Web Server will be started at port 8080\n")<br />        //See below for anonymous function<br /> http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {<br />  fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hi there, I love %s!", r.URL.Path)<br /> })<br /> http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)<br />}<br /></pre><br />Now a better way (in my opinion) to write the same code as above is shown below.<br /><pre class="c" name="code">package main<br /><br />import (<br /> "fmt"<br /> "net/http"<br />)<br /><br />func main() {<br /> fmt.Printf("Web Server will be started at port 8080\n")<br /> rootHandler := http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {<br />  fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hi there, I love %s!", r.URL.Path)<br /> })<br /><br /> srv := http.Server{<br />  Handler: rootHandler,<br />  Addr:    ":8080",<br /> }<br /><br /> srv.ListenAndServe()<br />}<br /><br /></pre>In this example, we are actually creating an instance of a Http Server as opposed to the previous example where the http global helper methods were used to start the Http Web Service.<br /><br />I was just curious to see how well this naive web service performs. Using apache bench, when I run 10000 requests at concurrency level of 100-700, the sample (stupid) program can serve around 5000 requests/second on my age old laptop. Just for kicks, the server in Go is atleast 5 times faster for each request as compared to the nodejs http server.<br /><br />Back to Go! ..<br /><br /><ol><li>Package has to be "main" for your main program. Otherwise, it does not work.</li><li>Passing -x flag to your helper commands such as "go run", "go fmt" or "go build" will display the complete output and the commands internally executed.</li><li>The "go build" has all compiler optimizations enabled.</li></ol></div>
