          <h2>Passing Command Line Arguments in Visual Studio</h2>

<div class="post">
Recently, my friend <a href="http://cs.uga.edu/~kishore">Kishore</a> asked me how to pass command line arguments to applications through Visual Studio. It has been long time since I ever passed any command line args to apps while debugging. For convenience sake, I usually hard code and later change it once I think my app does not break(which is not good ofcourse). Anyway, here is how you do ...<br /><br />1. Go to Solution Explorer. Right click on the project and click Properties<br />2. Now in the Properties page that you see, go to Debug tab.<br />3. In debug tab, go to Start Options Section in which you see a textarea with title "Command Line Arguments"<br /><br />Simple enough but not as easy as it should be. There should have been a menu item within build which you can use to directly pass arguments to your application. May be, a Visual Studio Add-in could do that, but the add-in development is very painful and the documentation does not match with what Visual Studio 2008 actually gives.
