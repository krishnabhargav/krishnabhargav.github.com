          <h2>Phone Interview Question ...</h2>

<div class="post">
I read this amazing article on how to get a phone interview right ...<br />http://steve.yegge.googlepages.com/five-essential-phone-screen-questions<br /><br />I think it is a must read for everyone - experienced and inexperienced students like myself. I feel I can answer atleast 80% of what is asked over there except the REGEX part of it, which I really have no clue. My RegEx is supported heavily by Google and I somehow feel lazy to learn RegEx. Anyway there was one such question, which I lift from the link i gave above.<br /><p> <span style="color:#7b68ee;"><em>Let's say you're on my team, and I've decided I'm a real stickler for code formatting. But I've got peculiar tastes, and one day I decide I want to have all parentheses stand out very clearly in your code. </em></span></p><span style="color:#7b68ee;"><em>   </em></span><p><span style="color:#7b68ee;"><em> So let's say you've got a set of source files in C, C++, or Java.  Your choice.  And I want you to modify them so that in each source file, every open- and close-paren has exactly one space character before and after it.  If there is any other whitespace around the paren, it's collapsed into a  single space character. </em></span></p>  <p><span style="color:#7b68ee;"><em> For instance, this code: </em></span></p><p><span style="color:#7b68ee;"> </span></p>  <p><span style="color:#7b68ee;"> <span style="font-family:courier, lucida, fixed;">   foo (bar (   new Point(x, graph.getY())   )); </span> </span></p>  <p><span style="color:#7b68ee;"> <em>Would be modified to look like this:</em> </span></p><span style="color:#7b68ee;">   </span><p><span style="color:#7b68ee;"> <span style="font-family:courier, lucida, fixed;">   foo ( bar ( new Point ( x, graph.getY ( ) ) ) ) ; </span> </span></p>  <p><span style="color:#7b68ee;"> <em>I tell you (as your manager) that I don't care how you solve this problem.  You can take the code down to Kinko's Copies and manually cut and paste the characters with scissors if you like. </em></span></p><span style="color:#7b68ee;"><em>   </em></span><p><span style="color:#7b68ee;"><em> How will you solve this problem?</em></span> </p> <br />My solution is very simple and I do not use RegEx, yet I could complete it in 3-4 minutes. Probably one with RegEx experience can do it in a minute. Also, the code shown below might be bugged and I did not test it yet. So in case you find a bug, let me know before I figure it out myself.<br /><br />def sampleCode = " foo (bar ( new Point(x, graph.getY()) ));"<br />sampleCode = sampleCode.replace(" (","(");<br />sampleCode = sampleCode.replace("( ","(");<br />sampleCode = sampleCode.replace(" )",")");<br />sampleCode = sampleCode.replace(") ",")");<br />sampleCode = sampleCode.replace(")"," ) ");<br />sampleCode = sampleCode.replace("("," ( ");<br />sampleCode = sampleCode.replace("  "," ");<br />println("Expected :  foo ( bar ( new Point ( x, graph.getY ( ) ) ) ) ;")<br />println "Obtained : "+sampleCode.trim()<br /><br />So do I get a job at Amazon?? Or atleast a phone interview call!
